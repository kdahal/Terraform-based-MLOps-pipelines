# Contributing to AI/ML Contributions

We love contributions! This repo helps you get started with AI/ML open-source. Follow these steps:

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repo**: Click "Fork" on GitHub.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-ml-contributions.git`
3. **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` (e.g., `feature/rag-gcp`).
4. **Make Changes**:
   - Add code to `/rag-implementations` or `/mlops-terraform`.
   - Update READMEs with usage.
   - Test: Run scripts locally; ensure no breaking changes.
5. **Commit**: `git add . && git commit -m "Add GCP RAG example"`
6. **Push**: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
7. **Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Open a PR to `main`.
   - Describe: What? Why? How to test?
   - Reference issues if applicable.

## Guidelines
- **Code Style**: PEP8 for Python; HCL best practices for Terraform.
- **RAG Contributions**: Include eval metrics (e.g., ROUGE scores). Use open models if possible.
- **MLOps Contributions**: Support multi-cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure). Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **No Conflicts**: Check for deps in `requirements.txt`.
- **Issues**: Use labels like "enhancement," "bug," "good-first-issue."

## Ideas for Contributions
- Implement RAG with LlamaIndex instead of LangChain.
- Add Terraform modules for Kubeflow or MLflow.
- Integrate monitoring (e.g., Prometheus for MLOps).
- Document real-world PRs to projects like [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
